# Music_Vizualizer
Some fun fast fourier transform based audio visualizers that utilize the built in microphone and pygame to display the visuals.


# Requirements
pip3 install pygame
pip3 install pyaudio
pip3 install numpy

# Updates
I will keep adding more features I am thinking, slower transitions between fractals that change with the music.
